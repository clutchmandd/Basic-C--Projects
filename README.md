# C-Sharp Projects
These are some small projects I made using C-Sharp and the .NET Framework. There are several other console and web apps in this folder besides the ones listed below. Feel free to browse around.
## Projects
[Car Insurance App](https://github.com/clutchmandd/C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/CarInsurance)
<br>[DateTime App](https://github.com/clutchmandd/C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/DateTimeApp)
### Car Insurance Quote
This project is an MVC Web Application that mimics a car insurance website. It takes in user's input on policy information and calculates a quote based on business logic. There is also an admin page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that have been issued.
### DateTime
This simple console app prints the current time to the console. The user is then asked to input a number to see what time it will be when that number is added in hours to the current time.
